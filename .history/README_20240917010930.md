## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For running the backend server
- **Express.js**: For building RESTful API
- **MongoDB**: As the database to store job sheet data
- **Mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB from Node.js
- **JWT**: For authentication (optional, if required)

### Tools:
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints
- **Git**: Version control
- **VSCode**: Development environment
